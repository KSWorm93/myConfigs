# Disclaimer
This is my folder for keeping config related stuff, it is outdated, and i would not recommend anyone using it this day and time.

## New Ubuntu Setup
If you want to setup Ubuntu to match my own.
Download this repository and run UbuntuSetup.sh

It will run a bunch of different commands, installing software and other configurations.
Please read through the file before running!

OBS: You will have to install Ubuntu Minimal on your own.

## Linux & Windows
These folders contain some scripts and other configs, that I used at some point a few years back.

## Future
I might revisit this in future and update what i am currently using.
